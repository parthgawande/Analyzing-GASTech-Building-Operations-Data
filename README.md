# üè¢VAST Challenge 2016: Analyzing GASTech Building Operations Data

This project, completed as part of the **VAST Challenge 2016**, focuses on analyzing operational data from the GASTech building. The data includes employee movements, HVAC sensor readings, and environmental parameters such as CO2 and Hazium gas levels. The goal of the project is to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and understand causal relationships between employee behavior and building conditions.

## üìä Key Visualizations
1. **Employee Movement Patterns**: Generated plots that show employee entry and exit times using proximity card data. These visualizations highlight anomalies, such as unusual card entries during non-working hours, indicating suspicious activities.
   
2. **HVAC and CO2 Data**: Time series plots of HVAC sensor data (temperature, energy usage, etc.) and CO2 levels. Specific days show abnormal peaks, particularly in CO2 levels, which could indicate operational inefficiencies or environmental issues.

3. **Hazium Gas Readings**: Visualization of Hazium gas concentrations across different floors, identifying hazardous events, particularly on the third floor where construction activities occur.
